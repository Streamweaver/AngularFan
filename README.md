Overview
========

Not much to see here. This is just some code I'm poking at as I work through some AngularJS and NodeJS tutorials for fun.

Dependencies
------------

The only dependencies are for running this under a nodejs http server for development which requires NodeJS (of course). The rest is setup through the package.json and bower.json files.

Running Development Server
--------------------------

To run the NodeJS Web server just go to a command line and type

```
  npm start
```
